# Face Mask Detection Project

This repository contains the following files related to a face mask detection project:

## Files

1. **Face_mask_detection_using_CNN.ipynb:** This is a Jupyter notebook that contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model used for face mask detection. The model is trained on the dataset from Kaggle (link provided below) and uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The notebook includes all the steps from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

2. **Final_Report.pdf:** This file contains a comprehensive report detailing the project, its objectives, the methodology used, and the results obtained. The report includes insights and visualizations generated from the model, and concludes with a discussion on the outcomes of the model and potential improvements that can be made.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the CNN model can be found at the following link: [Face Mask Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection). 

The dataset contains 853 images belonging to the 3 classes: 'With Mask', 'Without Mask', and 'Mask Worn Incorrectly'. These images are used to train the model to accurately detect whether an individual is wearing a mask, not wearing a mask, or wearing a mask incorrectly.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and run the Jupyter notebook locally, provided you have the necessary libraries installed. You will also need to download the dataset from Kaggle. Please refer to the 'Final_Report.pdf' for a thorough understanding of the project and the results obtained.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the model or implement additional features are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss the changes or submit a pull request. 

For any queries or discussions, please drop me a message.
